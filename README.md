# Vineyard Mailer
After taking my Udemy course on HTML email banners this is the final project.

The way that I learn projects like this is to follow along and create the site as I am learing. Take a day or two off and then make the site without any help from the course. If for some reason I did look at the course for help I start from scratch and repeat this step till I make the site without help.

### Skills:
- HTML
- inline CSS
- Responsivenes (layout changes based on size of window)
